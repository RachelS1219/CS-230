Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room had a mobile app that they wanted to expand to more consoles. The mobile app consisted of a library of 200 hi-def images that needed to be slowly rendered over 30 seconds. Users needed the ability to access the program and participate in the game at the same time in a a party. I had to figure out a client-server set up that would best support the expansion of their program.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I did a thorough job of researching the different development environments to find the right solution for the client.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Having clear cut goals and the ability to reflect back on the thought process throughout the development really helped to shape the best solution to each problem.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The system architecture was not a section I chose to evaluate but looking back I think I'd like to reassess at some point in my future to see how my thought process has hanged after having more experience/class time.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The entire purpose of a software program boils down to the end user experience. All software is designed for a purpose and how we interact with it is the most important part. To me it's like cooking a meal. You spend a lot of time on the preparations and ingredients, but the part you look forward to the most is eating it! If we aren't meeting the user's needs why are we choosing to create the software to begin with? One key factor to me while thinking of this design in particular was the fact they may consider future expansion. So I spent a great deal of time focusing on how to set them up for easy future maintenance/expansion.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I think a mix of goal setting and a thorough understanding of the end user experience best sets development up for success. I like to break things down into steps, separating the work and thought processes up into easier to manage sections that allow me to move forward on a project.
